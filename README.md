# ALGONOMIC-FLUX
Algorithmic-trading implemented using Machine learning Algorithm and various strategies including SMA, percentage increase and sentiment analysis.
The objective of this project is to develop an application in order to perform analysis on the historical stock data using more than one classifier and based on the classification, segregate them as buy, sell and hold. Thereby, justify the action to be taken in the future as per the mined opinion and outcome analyzed.
Also, Platforms like Quantopian to be used in order to perform back testing in a more precise and effective manner.

## Methodology

### 1. Algorithm for Classification of Stocks as Buy, Sell and Hold

### 2. Algorithm based on Simple Moving Average for Buy Sell and Hold Stock result in return of 29.55% on 1 million dollars paper-trading.

### 3. Defining pipeline for classification of stocks based on 3 testing factors:
<li>Testing_factor1 = operation margin of firm    =>  (operating income/ revenue ).
<li>Testing_factor2 = revenue_growth of firm      =>  (growth of firm revenue on % basis).
<li>Testing factors3=sentiment signal from sentdex=>  (sentiment analysis).
